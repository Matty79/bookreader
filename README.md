**Overview**

This app outputs the individual words that appear in a book, and how many times that word appears in the text file. It also outputs whether the number of times each word appears is a prime number.

**Guide**

1. You can run this app from the command line (e.g. Terminal) using the command 'ruby bookreader.rb' once inside the directory
2. Any online text (i.e. http://www.some_website.com/some_book.txt) can be swapped in and read by replacing the TEXT_URL string at the top of the bookreader.rb file
3. The app removes punctuation and capitalisation from the words counted and sorts the results in descending order
4. The app also indicates whether or not the number of times a word occurs is a prime number in the same line as the count itself
5. The sort method of this app has been optimised for speed
